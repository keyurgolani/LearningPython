Problem Statement

One day, Jamie noticed that many English words only use the letters A and B. Examples of such words include "AB" (short for abdominal), "BAA" (the noise a sheep makes), "AA" (a type of lava), and "ABBA" (a Swedish pop sensation).



Inspired by this observation, Jamie created a simple game. You are given two Strings: initial and target. The goal of the game is to find a sequence of valid moves that will change initial into target. There are two types of valid moves:

Add the letter A to the end of the string.
Reverse the string and then add the letter B to the end of the string.
Return "Possible" (quotes for clarity) if there is a sequence of valid moves that will change initial into target. Otherwise, return "Impossible".


Definition

Class:	ABBA
Method:	canObtain
Parameters:	String, String
Returns:	String
Method signature:	String canObtain(String initial, String target)
(be sure your method is public)


Constraints
-	The length of initial will be between 1 and 999, inclusive.
-	The length of target will be between 2 and 1000, inclusive.
-	target will be longer than initial.
-	Each character in initial and each character in target will be either 'A' or 'B'.

Examples
0)

"B"
"ABBA"
Returns: "Possible"
Jamie can perform the following moves:
Initially, the string is "B".
Jamie adds an 'A' to the end of the string. Now the string is "BA".
Jamie reverses the string and then adds a 'B' to the end of the string. Now the string is "ABB".
Jamie adds an 'A' to the end of the string. Now the string is "ABBA".
Since there is a sequence of moves which starts with "B" and creates the string "ABBA", the answer is "Possible".
1)

"AB"
"ABB"
Returns: "Impossible"
The only strings of length 3 Jamie can create are "ABA" and "BAB".
2)

"BBAB"
"ABABABABB"
Returns: "Impossible"
3)

"BBBBABABBBBBBA"
"BBBBABABBABBBBBBABABBBBBBBBABAABBBAA"
Returns: "Possible"
4)

"A"
"BB"
Returns: "Impossible"
