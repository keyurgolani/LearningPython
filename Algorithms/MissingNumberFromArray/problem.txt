Finding Missing Numbers
Let P be a permutation of {1,2,3,…n}. Example P={4,7,3,2,6,1,9,5,8,10}
Further, let P_(-1) be P with one element missing. Example P_(-1)={4,7,3,2,6,1,9,5,8,10}
Paul shows Carole P_(-1) [i] in increasing order i.
Carole’s task is to determine the missing integer. It is trivial to do the task if Carole can memorize all the numbers she has seen thus far (formally, she has an n-bit vector), but if n is large, this is impractical. Let us assume she has only a few – say O(log⁡n) – bits of memory. Nevertheless, Carole must determine the missing integer.
