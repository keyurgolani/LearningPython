# First priority is to give cheapest available space for a vehicle
# Second priority is to keep consecutive spaces available for buses
# Third priority is to give space near the entry
# Fourth priority is to give every vehicle something to park
# For handicapped people, if space other than handicapped space is assigned, he/she is charged according to the rate of the type of space.
# For handicapped people, first priority is handicapped space. If not available, larger space is priority over cheaper space
# Smaller cars do not have a parking at 1st floor. Hence, there's going to be compromise with the 'near to the entrance' preferance rather than to the 'cheaper place available' preference
